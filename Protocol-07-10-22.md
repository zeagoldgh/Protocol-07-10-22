# Monitoring System
The goals are to transform your processes to JSON.
## What is JSON
- JSON syntax is derived from(JavaScript Object Notation).
- JSON is a text format for storing and transporting data.
- JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
- JSON is plain text written in JavaScript object notation.
- JSON is used to send data between computers.
## Why use JSON
- The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
- Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.
- JavaScript has a built in function for converting JSON strings into JavaScript objects:
  JSON.parse()
- JavaScript also has a built in function for converting an object into a JSON string:
  JSON.stringify()
